# My-AI-Projects
This repository includes the projects I implemented for my AI courses and as a part of the tutorials I watched online.

## Projects
* **[Decision Tree Algorithm](Decision-Tree-Algorithm)** Project: This is a decision tree algorithm I implemented as a part of the [Cmpe 480 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence](https://www.cmpe.boun.edu.tr/tr/courses/cmpe480) coursework. The project builds the best decision tree for an Anime dataset I downloaded from Kaggle.
* **[Movies-Logistic-Regression-Model](Movies-Logistic-Regression-Model)** Project: This is a simple Logistic Regression implementation I coded when I was first introduced to the topic. I utilized a Movie review dataset from Kaggle.
* **[People-Height-and-Weight-DecisionTree-Regressor](People-Height-and-Weight-DecisionTree-Regressor)** Project: This is the very first ML model I implemented utilizing the DecisionTreeRegressor module of the sklearn library. This project was a part of the Intro to Machine Learning course on Kaggle.
