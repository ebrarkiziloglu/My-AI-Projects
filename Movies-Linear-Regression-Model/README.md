<h1 align="center">Basic Logistic Regression Model

</div>

I learned about the logistic regression models from [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat). Then, I implemented this basic model to predict movie reviews as positive ('pos') or negative ('neg'), based on the text review provided. 

I'm improving this project here as I learn more about ML libraries and models.

Here, I downloaded the database from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nltkdata/movie-review?select=movie_review.csv).
